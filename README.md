# New Relic Integration: A Tale of Two Sides (Frontend & Backend) 🎉

Welcome, developers! This README guides you through integrating New Relic into your projects, covering both frontend and backend implementations. Efficient monitoring is crucial for maintaining high-performing applications, and New Relic provides the tools to achieve just that. This repository offers comprehensive guides to streamline the integration process, minimizing the time spent on setup and maximizing the insights gained. Let's dive in and optimize your application's performance.

**The Two Towers of Monitoring:**

This repository contains separate guides for integrating New Relic with your frontend and backend:

- **Real-time monitoring:** See your application's performance in real-time, so you can catch issues before they become full-blown catastrophes. 💥
- **Detailed error tracking:** No more guessing games! New Relic helps you pinpoint the source of errors with precision. 🔎
- **Performance optimization:** Identify bottlenecks and optimize your application for peak performance. 📈

So, buckle up, and let's get started on this exciting adventure! May your applications be bug-free, your logs be clean, and your dashboards be beautiful. Good luck! 👍
